There was a small bug corrected in the cristalise-dev module which prevented proper assignment of workflows to Item descriptions. Please use the link below to download the new verion of the zip file.

[http://dev.cccs.uwe.ac.uk/cristalise-dev-3.0.zip](http://dev.cccs.uwe.ac.uk/cristalise-dev-3.0.zip)

Alternatively you can download the [cristalise-dev.jar](http://dev.cccs.uwe.ac.uk:8081/nexus/service/local/repositories/releases/content/org/cristalise/cristalise-dev/3.0/cristalise-dev-3.0.jar) only.

Restarting the cristal-dev server will update the relevant script (SetWorkflow) and fix the problem.
