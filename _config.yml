  The CRISTAL-ISE project aims to develop advanced knowledge of the CRISTAL Kernel in the Alpha 3i and 
  M1i research teams and to develop new technical skills at the University of the West of England (UWE). 
  This will address the next generation of M1i and Alpha3i customer requirements by facilitating 
  the semantic enhancement of the kernel and the interoperation of multiple instances of the Agilium product, 
  and will be demonstrated by deployment at Alpha3i and will enable researchersâ€™ development at UWE and M1i.
