  CRISTAL-iSE was designed to handle the complexity of data-intensive systems and provides the flexibility 
  to adapt to the changing scenarios typical of any production management system, or indeed 
  any process oriented system. This makes CRISTAL-iSE ideal for no-code/low-code application development.
