The CRISTAL-ISE project is a Marie Curie Actions, Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways
project funded by the European Union. The project is a collaboration between three partners, 
University of the West of England (UWE, UK), M1i (France) and Alpha-3i (France).

The CRISTAL-ISE project aims to develop advanced knowledge of the CRISTAL Kernel and progress
new technical skills, through collaborative research and secondments from research teams in
academia and industry. 

CRISTAL (Cooperative Repositories & Information System for Tracking Assembly Lifecycle) is a
description-driven system, which means that the data structures and workflow-driven behaviour
of the business objects in the system can be reconfigured at any time. It also supports versioning of
these definitions, so the old ones will still work when you do. Collected data may be mirrored into
several different databases concurrently and so can be queried for management summary data.
CRISTAL was original developed in collaboration with the European Centre for Nuclear Research
(CERN) and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) to track the construction of
the ECal detector at the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS): one of the main experiments at the Large
Hadron Collider (LHC).


The CRISTAL-iSE project has been evolving the core CRISTAL software to develop and launch versio
3. M1i, have for over a decade been exploiting the CRISTAL platform in the form of a BPM solution
called Agilium, and Alpha3i, will be using it to trace human resource allocation. These companies
have hosted academic researchers from UWE who have conducted a requirements analysis and
gathered data on how the software current use. UWE in turn are hosting three engineers from M1i
and Alpha-3i who will work with the research team at UWE to improve CRISTAL and expand their
knowledge of academic research. The first result of this project is to launch CRISTAL under an open
source license (LGPL3), making it free to use for all.
